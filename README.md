A simple neural network to classify hadwritten digits from the MNIST data set without the use of machine learning libraries, just pure maths.
The code for the neural network itself is in NeuralNetworkPure.py
A slightly altered version on the neural network is stored in NeuralNetwork.py which has some changes to allow for interaction with the GUI.
